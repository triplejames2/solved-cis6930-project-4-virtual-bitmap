In this project, you will implement virtual bitmap.

<h1>Virtual Bitmap</h1>

<strong>Input</strong>: a given file, project4input.txt, where the first line is the number n of flows, which is followed by n lines, each for a flow, containing its flow id (source address) and the number of distinct elements in the flow — for demo, n = 8,507, m = 500,000, l = 500  <strong>Function</strong>: record the elements of all flows in bitmap B of 500,000 bits; you may create elements as random numbers and you may record each element once or multiple times, which won’t make a difference. After recording, estimate the spread of each flow and plot a figure, where x-axis is the true spread and y-axis is the estimated spread. Each flow is represented by a point in the figure, whose x-coordinate is the flow’s actual spread and y-coordinate is the flow’s estimated spread. Set the range of x-axis to [0, 500].

<strong>Output for submission</strong>: a pdf figure as described above. An example is given below.
